#Credential vending for an application

Web identity Roles are created in the application. These roles are granted the
correct set of policies/permissions. These web identity roles are exported as
clodufromation exports which can then be looked up and used to create groups.
Groups are then administered (by whom?!) to include the correct set of users.
Once a user is added to a group they will then be able to access sts tokens
base on the web identity role's permissions and policy.
